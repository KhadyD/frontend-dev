# Relative File Paths

## Instructions

- See the folder [my-work/2-relative-paths](../../my-work/2-relative-paths/) for this activity's starter files.

- Then modify each of the four `html-bio.html` pages inside each of the `RelativePaths` folders, such that they can access the CSS inside their folder. Don't move the CSS file and don't move the HTML file.

- As a reference, you can view the `Demo` and `RelativePaths_WorkingExample` folders.

- Use relative linking to make it work! Use either the `Live Server` or `Open in Browser` VS Code extension to quickly test your changes.

- **Hint:** If you need some reading material on relative linking, you can use <https://css-tricks.com/quick-reminder-about-file-paths/>.

- If you finish early, help out those around you, or begin reading through the Learn CSS Layout Guide found here: <http://learnlayout.com/no-layout.html>.
